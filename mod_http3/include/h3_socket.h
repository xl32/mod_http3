/**
 * Open a non-blocking IPv6 dual-stack UDP socket and bind it to the given port.

 * Also asks for @p buffer_size on the send and receive buffers, which the OS
 * may cap; a refused or capped buffer is logged, never fatal.

 * @param buffer_size Bytes requested for SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF; 0 keeps the
 *               OS default.
 * @param pool  Pool used for the underlying apr_socket_t lifetime.
 * @param reuse_port Nonzero to set SO_REUSEPORT.
 * @param out_fd Out parameter: the resulting OS-level fd (suitable for
 *               SSL_set_fd on OpenSSL QUIC).
 * @return APR_SUCCESS, APR_EAGAIN if the port is already bound, or another
