# Build

The default build compiles OpenSSL, APR, APR-util, httpd, and nghttp3 from the repository submodules. This is the supported path when system packages do not meet the required httpd module magic number.

```sh
git submodule update --init
git submodule update --init --recursive dependencies/nghttp3
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

Only nghttp3 needs its own submodule (`lib/sfparse`). Recursing everywhere also clones OpenSSL's eleven external-test submodules, which the build never uses.

The module is written to `build/lib/mod_http3.so`.

## Requirements

The versions below are what the submodule build produces; supply your own with
the `WITH_*` options only if they meet these minimums.

| Dependency | Minimum |
| --- | --- |
| OpenSSL | 3.5.0 with QUIC support |
| Apache httpd | trunk (MMN 20211221) or 2.4.52+ |
| APR | 1.7.0 |
| APR-util | 1.6.0 |
| nghttp3 | 1.18.0 |

Against httpd trunk the module consumes response buckets directly; against 2.4.x it uses a built-in compatibility path (see `mod_http3/include/h3_compat.h`) that captures the response the way the core `HTTP_HEADER` filter would. On stock MPMs, which lack the optional `ap_mpm_note_extra_connection_added`/`_removed` functions, the module runs in a degraded mode where a graceful child stop does not wait for active QUIC connections to drain; the MPM patch in `.patches/httpd-2.4.66-pr699.patch` restores that.

## QUIC engine

`ENABLE_NGTCP2` decides which engines the module contains. The default needs
nothing extra:

```sh
cmake -B build                              # OpenSSL's QUIC only (default)
cmake -B build -DENABLE_NGTCP2=ON           # both, ngtcp2 from the submodule
```

Enabling ngtcp2 also builds `quic/third-party/ngtcp2`, which needs the OpenSSL
built alongside it; point `WITH_NGTCP2` at a prefix to use one you already have.
OpenSSL remains the TLS provider either way.

A build containing both picks one at start-up with `H3QuicEngine`; see
[architecture](architecture.md#quic-engines).

## Custom Prefixes

```sh
git submodule update --init dependencies/nghttp3
cmake -B build \
    -DWITH_SSL=/opt/openssl \
    -DWITH_HTTPD=/opt/httpd \
    -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
    -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF
cmake --build build
```

Set `WITH_APR` and `WITH_APU` when APR and APR-util are not part of the httpd prefix. See the [full installation reference](https://github.com/machine-moon/mod_http3/blob/trunk/INSTALL) for package builds and every CMake option.
