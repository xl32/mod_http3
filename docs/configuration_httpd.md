# mod_http3 httpd Configuration

Apache httpd configuration directives for mod_http3.

For build and installation, see [INSTALL](../INSTALL).

## Overview

mod_http3 enables HTTP/3 protocol support in Apache HTTP Server. The module:

- Creates a separate worker thread for HTTP/3 connections over UDP/QUIC
- Uses OpenSSL for QUIC/TLS 1.3 support
- Uses nghttp3 for HTTP/3 protocol handling
- Integrates with Apache's standard request processing pipeline

## Configuration Directives

### H3CertificatePath

**Syntax:** `H3CertificatePath /path/to/certificate.pem`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Required:** Yes

Path to the TLS certificate file for HTTP/3 connections. May point to the same file used by `SSLCertificateFile`.

### H3CertificateKeyPath

**Syntax:** `H3CertificateKeyPath /path/to/private-key.pem`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Required:** Yes

Path to the TLS private key file for HTTP/3 connections. May point to the same file used by `SSLCertificateKeyFile`.

### H3Port

**Syntax:** `H3Port port`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** the port of the VirtualHost that configured HTTP/3

UDP port the QUIC listener binds to. When unset, the module reuses the port of the VirtualHost that carries the `H3CertificatePath`/`H3CertificateKeyPath` pair, so TCP (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2) and UDP (HTTP/3) share the same port number. Set it explicitly to serve HTTP/3 on a different port.

### H3MaxConcurrentStreams

**Syntax:** `H3MaxConcurrentStreams n`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** `100`

Maximum number of concurrent HTTP/3 streams (in-flight requests) per QUIC connection.

### H3MaxConnections

**Syntax:** `H3MaxConnections n`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** `256`

Maximum number of concurrent QUIC/HTTP/3 connections per child process. New connection attempts beyond the limit are refused.

### H3SocketBufferSize

**Syntax:** `H3SocketBufferSize bytes`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** `2097152`

Bytes requested for the QUIC socket's send and receive buffers (`SO_SNDBUF` and `SO_RCVBUF`). The operating system caps what it grants -- on Linux through `net.core.wmem_max` and `net.core.rmem_max` -- and a refused or capped request is logged at `info` level rather than treated as an error, so raising this alone may not take effect. A receive buffer left at the OS default overflows once a single connection runs at speed, and every dropped datagram costs a retransmit and a congestion-window reduction.

### H3StreamBufferSize

**Syntax:** `H3StreamBufferSize bytes`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** `65536`

Per-stream request and streaming-response buffer size in bytes. For responses,
this bounds the producer/consumer queue between Apache request workers and the
QUIC event thread; a full queue applies backpressure to the request worker.

### H3MaxRequestBodySize

**Syntax:** `H3MaxRequestBodySize bytes`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** `10485760` (10 MiB)

Maximum HTTP/3 request body size in bytes. Request bodies are fully buffered in memory; requests exceeding the limit are rejected.

### H3MaxResponseBodySize

**Syntax:** `H3MaxResponseBodySize bytes`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** unlimited

Maximum HTTP/3 response body size in bytes. By default, responses stream through
the bounded queue controlled by `H3StreamBufferSize` and are not retained in
full. Setting an explicit finite limit switches that virtual host to bounded
whole-response buffering, allowing an over-limit response to be replaced with
a `500 Internal Server Error` before its headers or partial body are sent.

### H3AltSvc

**Syntax:** `H3AltSvc on|off`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** `on`

Whether to advertise HTTP/3 support by injecting an `Alt-Svc` response header. This is how browsers and other TCP clients discover that HTTP/3 is available over UDP. See [Alt-Svc Header](#alt-svc-header).

### H3AltSvcMaxAge

**Syntax:** `H3AltSvcMaxAge seconds`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** `86400`

Number of seconds a client may cache the `Alt-Svc` HTTP/3 advertisement (the `ma=` field of the injected header).

### H3HandshakeTimeout

**Syntax:** `H3HandshakeTimeout seconds`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** `10`

The timeout duration in seconds for QUIC handshakes to complete. If a connection is accepted but fails to finish the cryptographic TLS/QUIC handshake within this period, it is terminated and its resources are cleaned up. Helps prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

### H3IdleTimeout

**Syntax:** `H3IdleTimeout seconds`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** `300`

The idle timeout duration in seconds for QUIC connections. This maps to the standard QUIC `max_idle_timeout` transport parameter. A connection will be closed if no traffic is sent or received within this timeframe. Use a higher value for applications that require long-lived idle connections (e.g., long-polling, WebSockets over HTTP/3).

### H3AddressValidation

**Syntax:** `H3AddressValidation on|off`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** `on`

Whether to validate a client's source address before accepting a connection. When on, the server answers each new connection with a QUIC Retry packet (RFC 9000 section 8.1.2) and completes the handshake only after the client echoes the token back, which proves the client can receive at the address it claims. This is the defence against address-spoofed amplification attacks.

Turning it off removes one round trip from every connection, at the cost of that protection. Leave it on for internet-facing deployments. It exists mainly for interoperability testing, where a test may require a handshake that completes without an intervening Retry.

### H3QuicEngine

**Syntax:** `H3QuicEngine openssl|ngtcp2|null`
**Context:** server config, virtual host
**Default:** `openssl`

Which QUIC transport carries HTTP/3. `openssl` uses OpenSSL 3.5's own QUIC implementation and is always available. `ngtcp2` is present only when the module was built with `-DENABLE_NGTCP2=ON`; naming an engine the build does not contain is a fatal configuration error, so httpd refuses to start rather than quietly serving on the other one. OpenSSL provides TLS on both paths, so there is only ever one TLS stack in the process.

`null` implements the whole engine contract and carries no traffic: the server
listens but never completes a handshake. It exists to keep the contract
addable-to and to run the module with no transport underneath; do not select it
in production.

Naming an engine this build does not contain is rejected when the configuration
is parsed, so `httpd -t` catches it and names the engines that are compiled in.

The engine in use is reported by the `http3-status` handler as `quic_backend`.
That handler is not mapped anywhere by default; give it a location first:

```apache
<Location /http3-status>
    SetHandler http3-status
</Location>
```

## VirtualHost Configuration

### Port Detection

The module automatically detects the port from the VirtualHost configuration:

```apache
# HTTP/3 will listen on port 8443
<VirtualHost *:8443>
    ServerName secure.example.com
    H3CertificatePath /etc/httpd/ssl/secure.crt
    H3CertificateKeyPath /etc/httpd/ssl/secure.key
</VirtualHost>
```

Use `H3Port` to bind the QUIC listener to a different UDP port than the VirtualHost's TCP port.

### Multiple VirtualHosts

The module uses the **first VirtualHost** that has both `H3CertificatePath` and `H3CertificateKeyPath` configured:

```apache
# This VirtualHost is used for HTTP/3
<VirtualHost *:4433>
    ServerName primary.example.com
    H3CertificatePath /etc/httpd/ssl/primary.crt
    H3CertificateKeyPath /etc/httpd/ssl/primary.key
</VirtualHost>

# This VirtualHost is ignored for HTTP/3
<VirtualHost *:4433>
    ServerName secondary.example.com
    H3CertificatePath /etc/httpd/ssl/secondary.crt
    H3CertificateKeyPath /etc/httpd/ssl/secondary.key
</VirtualHost>
```

### Alt-Svc Header

mod_http3 injects the `Alt-Svc` response header automatically when HTTP/3 is configured (controlled by [`H3AltSvc`](#h3altsvc), on by default):

```
Alt-Svc: h3=":4433"; ma=86400; persist=1
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `h3=":4433"` | HTTP/3 available on same host, on the `H3Port` |
| `ma=86400` | Advertise for `H3AltSvcMaxAge` seconds |
| `persist=1` | Persist across network changes |

To customize the header beyond `H3AltSvcMaxAge`, set it manually via `mod_headers`; the module does not overwrite an already-present `Alt-Svc` header:

```apache
Header always set Alt-Svc "h3=\":4433\"; ma=60; persist=1"
```

Disable the advertisement entirely with `H3AltSvc off`.

### EnableMMAP

`EnableMMAP` is fully supported. The output filter accepts and processes both raw file and memory-mapped (`MMAP`) data buckets transparently.

## Troubleshooting

### Startup Validation

The module validates configuration during Apache startup:

1. **Certificate Path Check:** `H3CertificatePath` is configured
2. **Key Path Check:** `H3CertificateKeyPath` is configured

If either check fails, Apache refuses to start.

### Testing Configuration

```sh
httpd -t                              # test syntax
httpd -t -D DUMP_VHOSTS               # verbose
httpd -M | grep http3                 # check module
```

### Verifying HTTP/3 Operation

```sh
ss -ulnp | grep httpd                 # check UDP listener
curl --http3 -k https://localhost:4433/   # test transfer
tail -f /var/log/httpd/error_log      # watch logs
```

### Debug Logging

```apache
LogLevel http3:trace8
```

### Log Messages

```
# Successful configuration

### Security

```sh
# Set restrictive permissions
chmod 600 /etc/httpd/ssl/server.key
chown root:root /etc/httpd/ssl/server.key

# Or if Apache runs as a different user
chown apache:apache /etc/httpd/ssl/server.key
```
